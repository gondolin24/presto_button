# presto_button

Very simple app to try my hand at android app development.
Just a button. When you hit the button, it starts a 2 hour timer.
You get a notification when the timer is up.
This is to track the time you have on your Presto 2-hour
transfer on the TTC.

Yes I know every phone has a built in timer. This is for fun.
